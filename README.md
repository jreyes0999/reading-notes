# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is being *open* to receiving _new information_, _others viewpoints_, and being able to _openly_ discuss issues without trying to downplay others. This is **_key_** to being able to grasp understanding of the expanding world around you. There is no gain without effort and I can attest to that through getting better at certain games through muscle memory and repition. **Don't** be afraid to ask questions and learn from other leaders or peers, there's no reason to be ashamed at not being able to solve a problem and ask for help, I've also learned this the hard way, since I am **very** stubborn and sometimes have a fixed, toxic mindset. I have been inspired by many people that I now hold as dear friends to me.
