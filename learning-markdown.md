## GitHub Pages

GitHub pages allows you to turn your repositories into websites to showcase your notes, projects, or documentation, as well as being able to include themes. 

## How does GitHub Pages work?

- Github is the server that hosts all your project sites with your own url which is linked to the username you signed up with. 

- GitHub looks for web content on your Github Pages branch.

- You can create sites for yourself or your organization by creating a repository with your GitHub page url as it's name, then adding web content to it's master branch.
