## Operators
* JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators
* JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:
```
operand1 operator operand2
3+4 or x*y
```
* A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.
    * operator operand (x++)
    * operand operator (++x)
## Assignment operators
* An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
    * Assignment `x = y	 x = y`
    * Addition assignment `x += y	x = x + y`
    * Subtraction assignment `x -= y  x = x - y`
    * Multiplication assignment	`x *= y	 x = x * y`
    * Division assignment `x /= y  x = x / y`
    * Remainder assignment `x %= y  x = x % y`
## Comparison operators
* Equal (==) - Returns true if the operands are equal.
* Not equal (!=) - Returns true if the operands are not equal.
* Strict equal (===) - Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type
* Strict not equal (!==) - Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.
* Greater than (>) - Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
* Greater than or equal (>=) - Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
* Less than (<)	- Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
Less than or equal (<=)	- Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
## Arithmetic operators
* An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value
    * Remainder (%)	- Binary operator. Returns the integer remainder of dividing the two operands.
    * Increment (++) - Unary operator. Adds one to its operand. If used as a prefix operator (++x), returns the value of its operand after adding one; if used as a postfix operator (x++), returns the value of its operand before adding one.
    * Decrement (--) - Unary operator. Subtracts one from its operand. The return value is analogous to that for the increment operator.
    * Unary negation (-) - Unary operator. Returns the negation of its operand.
    * Unary plus (+) - Unary operator. Attempts to convert the operand to a number, if it is not already.
    * Exponentiation operator (**) - Calculates the base to the exponent power, that is, base^exponent
## Logial Operators
* Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.\
    * Logical AND (&&) - expr1 && expr2	Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
    * Logical OR (||) - expr1 || expr2	Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, || returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.
    * Logical NOT (!) - !expr	Returns false if its single operand that can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.
**&& Operator**
```
var a1 =  true && true;     // t && t returns true
var a2 =  true && false;    // t && f returns false
var a3 = false && true;     // f && t returns false
var a4 = false && (3 == 4); // f && f returns false
var a5 = 'Cat' && 'Dog';    // t && t returns Dog
var a6 = false && 'Cat';    // f && t returns false
var a7 = 'Cat' && false;    // t && f returns false
```
**|| Operator**
```
var o1 =  true || true;     // t || t returns true
var o2 = false || true;     // f || t returns true
var o3 =  true || false;    // t || f returns true
var o4 = false || (3 == 4); // f || f returns false
var o5 = 'Cat' || 'Dog';    // t || t returns Cat
var o6 = false || 'Cat';    // f || t returns Cat
var o7 = 'Cat' || false;    // t || f returns Cat
```
**! Operator**
```
var n1 = !true;  // !t returns false
var n2 = !false; // !f returns true
var n3 = !'Cat'; // !t returns false
```

## String operators
* In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.
```
console.log('my ' + 'string'); // console logs the string "my string".
```
* The shorthand assignment operator += can also be used to concatenate strings.
```
var mystring = 'alpha';
mystring += 'bet'; // evaluates to "alphabet" and assigns this value to mystring.
```
# Loops and iteration
* Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.
* You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:
```
for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
```
* The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
    * for statement
    * do...while statement
    * while statement
    * labeled statement
    * break statement
    * continue statement
    * for...in statement
    * for...of statement
* A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. 
```
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
```
![for loop execution](https://flux.s-ul.eu/qXjU1SEX.png)
* A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
```
while (condition)
  statement
  ```
* If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
* The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
    * To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3:
```
let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
```
![Example Above](https://flux.s-ul.eu/P2DvYcWr.png)
* **Avoid infinite loops**. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes falseâ€”otherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false:
```
// Infinite loops are bad!
while (true) {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```
